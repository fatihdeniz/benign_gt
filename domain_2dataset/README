Malicious and Benign Webpages Dataset~\cite{dataset:singh2020malicious} is a publicly available dataset, originally released by Singh and Kumar in 2020. It was compiled by crawling the internet using the Mal Crawler tool~\cite{malcrawler:wang2013click}, with labels generated through Google Safe Browsing~\cite{gsb}. In contrast, PDNS-Net~\cite{dataset:kumarasinghe2022pdns} comprises domains found within the expanded graph of a predefined set of selected malicious seed domains obtained from VirusTotal~cite{virustotal}, utilizing passive DNS.
