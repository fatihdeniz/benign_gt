This is android malware dataset:

Classifier: For the underlying classifier, we use Drebin, which uses a linear SVM and a binary feature space where components (activities, permissions, URLs, etc) are represented as present or absent.

Here we created the experimental setup discussed by Arp et al. [Dos Donts].

Please check the notebooks to see the groups of the selected indices. It also contains a universe group.
